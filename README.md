Might & Fealty
==============

This is the rewritten source code for the game [Might & Fealty](http://mightandfealty.com), a browser based, persistent, role playing game (RPG) with turn-based strategy elements written in PHP**8** on the Symfony**6** framework, using a PostgreSQL database for entity handling and QuantumGIS for map functionality.

While the license doesn't forbid it, it's **strongly discouraged** to setup a separate game server, as it would split the player base and result in both servers failing to generate the dynamics needed to keep the game interesting to play. Instead, we'd encourage you to contribute your ideas and time to this project, which is the source code for the main Might & Fealty game, so we can make it a game that encompasses anything players want to do.

Documentation
-------------

At this time, documentation for this code is still being written, however some documentation can be found in the code itself.

Completeness
------------

The repository is **not** a complete standalone copy of the game. While it contains all the code, the game world data is missing. There is, also, old code in the repository that was **not** actually used to create the game world. To create a game world, you need additional scripts and manual work in something like QuantumGIS.
