There are a great many ancient relics left in the world, things that survived the cataclysms of the Gods War, but now sit lost and unknown to those around them.

History tells of a world where First Ones not only inhabited the world, but explored it, mapped it, shaped it, and reshaped it. Tales of massive constructs that rivaled the very mountains in scale. Legends of ancient cities speak of gateways that connected distant lands, bringing far flung isles just a step away and offering a glimpse to new heavens above. Stories of ancient arts that let them master even the skies. Myths of infinite catacombs laced every step with horrid beasts. Whispers of dark and ancient beings that rivaled even the gods.

It is from these legends that our second foray into distant worlds begins anew, harnessing the crafts and manpower of the younger alongside the constructs of our past to forge our way once more into distant lands forgotten by the Gods, risking our very lives to reclaim the glory of our past.

As we venture out, we can only wonder, is the first time we have been here? 

Have we walked this road before? 

Did the Gods create these lands as they made ours?

Were we the first?

Are we the last?

In the darkness of our journey, we cannot help but feel that we are not as alone as we think.
