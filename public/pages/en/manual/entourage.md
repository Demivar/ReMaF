Non-fighting members following a noble character around are given the summary term *entourage*.

Most of these people expand the options and available actions in the game for you. Like [soldiers], entourage is trained at [settlements] and can be assigned to others as well.

*Scouts* and *Camp Followers* do not give you new options, but simply increase a property, which means that recruiting several of them also increases the benefit you gain.  
*Merchants* and *Heralds* sometimes stay behind to secure their benefits for you on a continual basis. You should usually have as many with you as you expect to use before you can recruit more.  
For other entourage members, you typically want a low number, basically one to secure you the option and one or two as reserve.

Entourage *can* be killed during battle, if your forces are routed from the battlefield, but it does not happen very often. Like soldiers, they also need food and will starve if there is nothing to eat for an extended time.
