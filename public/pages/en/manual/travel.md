Travel is what gets your character(s) around the world in Might & Fealty. If you want to get somewhere, you need to travel there. There is no teleport or other form of instant transport in the game.


Basic Travel
------------
To travel somewhere, open up the map and change the mode to "travel". Then simply add waypoints to the map by clicking on it. When you are happy, press the "set travel" button and the game will check and set your route, or show you what the problem is if your route is impossible.

Two things can prevent your travel: Impassable terrain or rivers.


### Terrain ###
Some high mountains cannot be crossed and neither can lakes or oceans (see below for sea travel). You will have to move around them.

### Rivers ###
Rivers can only be crossed with bridges. To use a bridge, simply make sure your route crosses the river at the bridge location, the bridge itself does not have to be a waypoint (though this is the easiest way to make sure everything works).

### Cliffs ###
Sometimes, mostly in mountains, a sheer cliff face blocks any travel, in both directions. Cliffs cannot be crossed, you have to move around them. 
They are marked with a dotted line on the map (only visible when you are somewhat zoomed in).


Travel Speed
------------
Marching an army anywhere can take a long time. However, you can influence the speed of travel in many ways. In many cases, the shortest way is not the fastest, and good route-planning can save you a lot of time. Consider these main factors:

### Army Size ###
The larger your army, the slower you travel. Both soldiers and entourage members will slow you down somewhat. Your character status page will always display your current travel speed.

### Terrain ###
Travel speed also depends on the terrain you are travelling through. Moving through open areas is faster than moving through the forest, and moving through swamps or mountains is slower still. The difference is considerably. You will move almost twice as fast through easy terrain than through the most difficult.

### Roads ###
Roads allow you to travel at speed over difficult terrain, speeding your travel up. They have the greatest effect when the ground is otherwise treacherous, but even on the plains, a road will slightly improve your travel speed. The quality of the road determines how much it will speed up travel. In treacherous terrain, a good road can more than double your speed, so following roads is generally a good idea, even if it makes the trip a bit longer by miles.


Sea Travel
----------
You can travel by sea after embarking at a dock (embarking is an action, on the actions screen), if permitted by the lord of the nearby settlement. When you travel at sea, you always move at the speed of the ship, meaning your soldiers and entourage do not slow you down.

When travelling at sea, simply end your travel anywhere on land and you will automatically disembark where your route hits solid ground, switching you to normal land travel. Docks are not necessary to disembark, only to embark.

Your ships will wait for you at the disembark point for 60 days, working much like docks do, but only for you. You *can* grant ships to other characters, allowing them to take them in your stead. This removes them from your ownership, possibly leaving you stranded on an island, so be careful with this option.

Even at sea, your soldiers will need food, so be aware of that. While there will be a bit of fishing, mostly you will have to cover the food required with camp followers.

Other than land travel, there is a small uncertainty in sea travel. Storms and bad weather can force you to land or wreck your ships, stranding you where you didn't want to be. It is a small chance, but it exists.


Region Familiarity
------------------
As you travel the world, you begin to know the places that you visit. Travelling through or staying in a region will increase your familiarity with this region. This represents your discovery of shortcuts, strategically important locations to use for battles, local peculiarities that might come in handy, which roads are good or bad, where to find water or good resting places and a hundred other small details.
Familiarity will slightly improve your travel speed through a region and can give you strategic advantages in battle.
