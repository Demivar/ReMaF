Might & Fealty primarily draws it's funding from [Andrew's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/andrewdoesprogramming), with supplements from in-game purchases of credits. It is our hope that these will, in time, generate enough income to cover server operation costs and allow the exploration of more interesting ideas.

As such, there are no "pay to win" features in M&F, nor does paying game credits for a subscription or in-game purchasables grant you any sort of in-game bonuses. You play the same game as anyone else, though you can choose to unlock items that allow you to tweak how things are presented or allow you to leave more of your contributions in the lore and history of the world.

Our goals of *honesty* and *fairness* are accomplished by us watching your characters and account for activity and marking it as
inactive or "in storage" automatically if we see that you have not logged in for a while. This way, if you go on holidays, extended absence, or just don't have time to play for a while, we aren't treating you like a cash cow, but instead reduce your subscription costs automatically and keep your account safe until you return.

We believe that real-life takes precedence and sometimes you just can't or can't be bothered to make your absence known to every online site where you have an account. We won't punish you for going away - aside from what other players do to you while you're not around, nothing bad will happen to your characters. And we acknowledge that when you don't play, you are using almost none of our resources and infrastructure.

A word on advertisement:

Many similar games are financed by advertisement, i.e. by showing you ads within the game. Might & Fealty does not and *never* will bother you with ads as a means of financing the game. [Advertisement is exploitation](http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/07/14/4273200.htm) and anti-social, and we are not that kind of people.
