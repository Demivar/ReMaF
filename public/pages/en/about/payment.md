We believe in honesty and transparency and we wish to establish a foundation of trust with our customers/players. To promote these goals, we have established a fair payment concept where we strive to treat you well, first of all.

Our goal of *transparency* is accomplished by having a simple and easy to understand structure. You essentially need to remember only two things: There are a few levels of membership, and they mainly depend on the number of characters you want to be able to play in parallel (so you can have as many dead ancestors as you want, they are free).

The purpose of basing the levels on character count is twofold: One, we believe that players who play more casual and use less of the game should not pay as much as those who play as much as they can manage to. And two, a small incentive to not do everything in-game with just a fresh character of yourself, but get other players in on the action.

The exception to this rule is that free accounts are limited in respect to politics, such as not being able to create realms and only allowing a limited number of estates. When you hit these limits after some time of playing, you can decide if you enjoy the game enough to pay for a subscription, or continue to play for free at this level.


Our goals of *honesty* and *fairness* are accomplished by us watching your characters and account for activity and marking it as
inactive or "in storage" automatically if we see that you have not logged in for a while. This way, if you go on holidays, extended absence, or just don't have time to play for a while, we aren't treating you like a cash cow, but instead reduce your subscription costs automatically and keep your account safe until you return.

We believe that real-life takes precedence and sometimes you just can't or can't be bothered to make your absence known to every online site where you have an account. We won't punish you for going away - aside from what other players do to you while you're not around, nothing bad will happen to your characters. And we acknowledge that when you don't play, you are using almost none of our resources and infrastructure.

A word on advertisement:

Many similar games are financed by advertisement, i.e. by showing you ads within the game. Might & Fealty does not and *never* will bother you with ads as a means of financing the game. [Advertisement is exploitation](http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/07/14/4273200.htm) and anti-social, and we are not that kind of people.
