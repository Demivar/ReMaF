Using a comfortable interface, the game is a mixture of turn-based and immediate actions. The basic game-mechanics concept is that everything takes time to complete. Actions where your character simply orders them and they then progress on their own are initiated immediately and then updated over time. For example, if you order the construction of a market place, the order is given immediately and you are done, but it will take some time for the construction work to be completed.

Actions that require your character to actually do something are planned and put into an *action queue*. When you are offline, your character will work through the action queue. Everything takes time, be it travel or the attack on an enemy castle. The fact that things take time also gives other players time to react to your activities, but since you have a real life as well, you can set up standing orders that last until you remove them. If you want to defend a village, or your king, simply define that as a standing order and if they get attacked, your character will automatically react.


As development of the game continues, we plan a deeper integration of the game into the tools of your daily life, allowing you to receive notifications about important in-game events on any channel you prefer, so that you do not have to check the game constantly for anything happening, but can be free of worry knowing that if something requires your attention, you will be notified.
