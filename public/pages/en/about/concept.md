There are a number of core philosophies behind the design of Might & Fealty. These concepts guide everything about the game.

Sandbox
-------

The idea of a sandbox is that the game does not limit the players. The core thought is:

**You can do anything - but everything you do has consequences.**

So there should never be a point where the game says "you cannot attack this person" or "you cannot loot this village". The only rules the game enforces are the laws of physics. If you don't have enough resources to build a castle, then you can't do it. But interactions between players - both hostile and friendly - are entirely free. The game should enable these, and not prevent them.


Eternity
--------

The game is made for eternity. Everything gets recorded, nothing important ever gets deleted (some items have a limited lifetime, of course). Characters and accounts, for example, will stay around. Sure, your estates will be conquered by other players, but when you come back three years later, your characters will still be there, with all their history intact.

History does not exist if nobody is there to write it down. The game keeps a record. If you want to know who was the lord of the town you just conquered two years ago - you can look it up.


Emergent Structures
-------------------

The game should enable interaction with other players and should make them necessary and rewarding. It should not force them into pre-determined paths, but allow for any kind of political system, hierarchy and organisation to evolve.

Emergent behaviours and structures should form the social network of the game, allowing for the maximum amount of player freedom. The game mechanics should cover only the most important data points and leave everything else to players to shape and form as they desire.


Limited Resources
-----------------

The game economy should not be subject to unlimited exponential growth, but instead adequately simulate a medieval world with limited resources and very limited options of increasing productivity. The game is not about everyone building up trying to build faster than others. Such a game would by necessity be limited in time and not (see above) eternal.

Instead of growth, Might & Fealty places *exchange*. Trade, tribute or plunder shift resources around the game world and allow some to prosper at the expense of others. Every city in the game should exist because a number of other places have not been grown into cities - there simply are not enough resources for every settlement to be a city.
