Might & Fealty is an entirely player-driven, persistent world where history is being made, not just replayed.

---

A roleplaying game, a strategy game, a political and negotiations game.

A simulation of a medieval / low-fantasy world not in the sense of realistic physics, but in the sense of having humans with human motivations and personal ambitions as the driving forces.

There is no predetermined storyline or victory condition. In fact, there is no victory in the sense that it ends the game, the whole game is designed to last forever and remain playable for many years. That does not mean re-play, it means *one continuous history* of the world. History created, written and interpreted by players.

Might & Fealty started, in 2013, as the project of Tom Vogt. A few years later, in 2017, it properly became the project of its players, who have picked up where he left off, with the goal of making it the best possible game it could be.

More than a game, it is a political and social sandbox. It is not even a simulation, it is the real thing in a smaller box. The first, more gamey and primitive incarnation of this - [BattleMaster](http://battlemaster.org) - has been so close to real life at times that it has sparked interest in teachers, history freaks and university professors.

The main properties of Might & Fealty are emergence and freedom. There is no game-developer-provided story, and yet there will be hundreds of stories. Real stories, not made-up ones. 10 years from now, there will be an actual history. Wars, revolutions, empires and kings that really existed, not just inventions of a story writer.

Unlike most games, the approach we take resembles the uncertainties and ambiguities of real life. You are the good guys not because the game defines so, but because you say so. And your enemies say the same thing about themselves. The actual gameplay emerges from player-to-player interactions on all levels. It is unpredictable, ever-changing and thrilling. And it is more varied and interesting than the best writing team could ever generate.
